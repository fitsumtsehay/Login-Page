### Introduction
Spring Boot provides a powerful and flexible framework for building secure web applications. By using Spring Security and following best practices for authentication and authorization, one can create a login security app that protects sensitive user data and ensures the privacy and security of your users.
### Here's an overview of the steps involved in implementing login security in a Spring Boot application using Spring Security:

- Begin by creating a new Spring Boot project using a preferred IDE and selecting either Maven or Gradle as the build system.

- Add the Spring Security dependency to the project, enabling you to secure the application and set access rules for different users.

- Configure Spring Security in the project by creating a new class that extends the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class. This class defines the authentication provider,   which can be an in-memory provider, a JDBC provider, or an LDAP provider. It also defines access rules for specific URLs or methods.

- Create a login page by adding an HTML page to the resources/templates directory. This page should include a form with input fields for username and password, and a submit button. When the user submits the form, Spring Security validates the credentials and redirects the user to the appropriate page.

- Create a logout page by adding an HTML page to the resources/templates directory. This page should include a logout button. When the user clicks the button, Spring Security invalidates the session and redirects the user to the appropriate page.

- Secure the application resources by defining security rules for specific URLs or by securing specific methods or controllers. For example, you can secure all URLs that start with /admin by adding the appropriate security rule.

- Test the application by running it and accessing the login page. Once logged in, access to secured resources should be available. To log out, simply access the logout page.
